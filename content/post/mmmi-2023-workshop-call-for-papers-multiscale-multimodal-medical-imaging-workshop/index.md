## **Overview**

Facing the growing amount of data available from multiscale multimodal medical imaging facilities and a variety of new methods for the image analysis developed so far, this MICCAI workshop aims to move the forward state of the art in multiscale multimodal medical imaging, including both algorithm development, implementation of the methodology, and experimental studies. The workshop also aims to facilitate more communications and interactions between researchers in the field of medical image analysis and the field of machine learning, especially with expertise in data fusion, multi-fidelity methods, and multi-source learning.
