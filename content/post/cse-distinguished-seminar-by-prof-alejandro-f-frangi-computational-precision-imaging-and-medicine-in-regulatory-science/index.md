In this talk, I will overview our progress in the INSILEX Programme. We
envision a paradigm shift in medical device innovation where quantitative
sciences are exploited to carefully engineer medical device designs,
explicitly optimise clinical outcomes, and thoroughly test side effects
before being marketed.

INSILEX is underpinned by Computational Medicine, an emerging discipline
devoted to developing quantitative approaches for understanding the
mechanisms, diagnoses, and treatment of human disease through the
systematic application of mathematics, engineering, and computational
science. Dealing with the extraordinary multi-scale complexity and
variability intrinsic to human biological systems and health data demands
radically new approaches compared to methods for manufactured systems.

Within this framework, INSILEX extensively uses medical image computing, a
mature field challenged by the progress made across all medical imaging
technologies and more recent breakthroughs in biological imaging. We
advocate for “Precision Imaging”, not as a new discipline but a distinct
emphasis in medical imaging, unifying the efforts behind mechanistic and
phenomenological model-based imaging.

This talk summarises and formalises our vision of Precision Imaging for
Precision Medicine and highlights connections with past research and our
current focus on large-scale computational phenomics and in silico
clinical trials.
