## **Introduction**
[MICCAI (Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention)](http://www.miccai.org/) is an internationally recognized, highly influential academic conference in the field of medical image analysis. Its main goal is to promote research and innovation in medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention. Participants share their latest research results, technological innovations, and practical experiences at the conference. The conference includes various forms of activities such as academic paper presentations, poster exhibitions, and challenges. The main topics of the MICCAI conference cover medical image analysis, computer-assisted intervention, medical imaging systems, and applications. The conference is held once a year and attracts researchers, engineers, and doctors from academia and industry worldwide.

As one of the important challenges of MICCAI 2023, the [Myopic Maculopathy Analysis Challenge (MMAC)](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12441) hosted by the MICCAI Society, and jointly organized by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tsinghua Medicine, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Singapore National Eye Center, and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, was officially opened for registration on **April 23, 2023**. Everyone is welcome to participate.

## **Background**

Myopic maculopathy is a significant threat to vision health worldwide, and fundus photography is a commonly used imaging method for its diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of myopic maculopathy is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the experience of ophthalmologists, which highlights the importance of developing an effective computer-aided system for analyzing myopic maculopathy. Additionally, the lack of open benchmark datasets limits the development of computer-aided diagnosis algorithms, further emphasizing the need for a fair and impartial dataset for evaluating myopic maculopathy diagnosis algorithms.

The MICCAI-MMAC challenge aims to promote the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the diagnosis of myopic maculopathy by encouraging researchers to develop algorithms for different tasks, including myopic maculopathy classification, segmentation of myopic maculopathy lesions and prediction of equivalent spherical refractive error. This challenge provides a platform for algorithm development, testing, and fair comparison with other algorithms to support the diagnosis and treatment of myopic maculopathy.

Participants are free to choose one or more tasks to participate in the challenge, which includes three tasks as mentioned above.
