The [2023 ICLR Workshop on Trustworthy Machine Learning for Healthcare (TML4H)](https://sites.google.com/view/tml4h2023) has successfully concluded! We would like to thank the Advisory and Program Committees for their strong support, as well as the Student Organizers for their dedicated assistance. The conference received endorsement from MICCAI and featured six keynote speakers and 18 oral presentations. Accepted papers will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series, similar to top conferences such as MICCAI and ECCV. One Best Paper Award (for interpretable research by Konstantin from the University of Cambridge) and two Honorable Mentions were awarded. We look forward to seeing everyone again at next year's TML4H workshop!

## **Overview**

Machine learning (ML) has achieved or even exceeded human performance in many healthcare tasks, owing to the fast development of ML techniques and the growing scale of medical data. However, ML techniques are still far from being widely applied in practice. Real-world scenarios are far more complex, and ML is often faced with challenges in its trustworthiness such as lack of explainability, generalization, fairness, privacy, etc. Improving the credibility of machine learning is hence of great importance to enhance the trust and confidence of doctors and patients in using the related techniques. We aim to bring together researchers from interdisciplinary fields, including but not limited to machine learning, clinical research, and medical imaging, etc., to provide different perspectives on how to develop trustworthy ML algorithms to accelerate the landing of ML in healthcare.
