abstract: |-
  Artificial intelligence, especially deep learning with large-scale
  annotated datasets, has dramatically advanced the recognition performance
  in many domains including speech recognition, visual recognition and
  natural language processing. Despite its breakthroughs in above domains,
  its application to medical image analysis remains yet to be further
  explored, where large-scale fully and high-quality annotated datasets are
  not easily accessible. In this talk, I will share our recent progress on
  developing label-efficient learning methods by leveraging an abundance of
  weakly-labeled and/or unlabeled datasets for medical image analysis, with
  application to disease diagnosis, lesion localization and segmentation.
