summary: Deep learning-based imaging analysis is capable of providing more
  efficient and accurate diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases, thereby assisting
  ophthalmologists and filling the gap between increasing clinical demands and
  limited resources. This project focuses on developing advanced image
  enhancement techniques and multi-task disease diagnosis & analysis models by
  analyzing multiple ophthalmic imaging modalities, such as fundus photo,
  optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCTA angiography (OCTA). We aim to
  develop a full-stack system for enabling intelligent analysis in
  ophthalmology.

### **Summary**

Deep learning-based imaging analysis is capable of providing more efficient and accurate diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases, thereby assisting ophthalmologists and filling the gap between increasing clinical demands and limited resources. This project focuses on developing advanced image enhancement techniques and multi-task disease diagnosis & analysis models by analyzing multiple ophthalmic imaging modalities, such as fundus photo, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCTA angiography (OCTA). We aim to develop a full-stack system for enabling intelligent analysis in ophthalmology.
