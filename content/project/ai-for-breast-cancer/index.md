  Breast cancer has become the most diagnosed malignancy worldwide and the primary cause of cancer mortality in women, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths in 2020. Early screening and diagnosis of breast cancer can effectively improve the five-year survival rate of patients. Meanwhile, personalized neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction can reduce unnecessary suffering from toxic therapy and economic cost for patients who have poor responses. In this project, we aim to establish a deep learning-assisted system for breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment response prediction from multimodal data, so as to improve the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy of doctors while increasing the life quality of patients significantly via personalized treatment.

Breast cancer has become the most diagnosed malignancy worldwide and the primary cause of cancer mortality in women, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths in 2020. Early screening and diagnosis of breast cancer can effectively improve the five-year survival rate of patients. Meanwhile, personalized neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction can reduce unnecessary suffering from toxic therapy and economic cost for patients who have poor responses. In this project, we aim to establish a deep learning-assisted system for breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment response prediction from multimodal data, so as to improve the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy of doctors while increasing the life quality of patients significantly via personalized treatment.
