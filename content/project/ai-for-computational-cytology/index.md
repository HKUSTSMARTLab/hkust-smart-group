  Computational cytology enables efficient and accurate cancer screening and early diagnosis such as liquid-based cytology in cervical cancer screening, reducing the heavy workload on cytologists by identifying the suspicious abnormal cells. In this project, we focus on building a deep learning assisted cytology analytical system and consequently predicting diagnostic outcomes. We will build a data standardization platform for specimen collection, imaging, and annotation. Furthermore, we will develop advanced deep learning algorithms for quantifying cell-level and whole slide image (WSI)-level analytical results. We aim to develop an integrated system for data acquisition, imaging analysis, visualization and human-machine collaboration.
