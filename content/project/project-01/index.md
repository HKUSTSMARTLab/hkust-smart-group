title: Deep Learning-assisted System for Breast Cancer
date: 2022-08-01
summary: Breast cancer has become the most diagnosed malignancy worldwide, the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality globally, and the primary cause of cancer mortality in women, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths in 2020. Early screening and diagnosis of breast cancer can effectively improve the five-year survival rate of breast cancer patients. Meanwhile, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction can reduce unnecessary suffering from toxic therapy and economic cost for patients who have poor responses. In this project, we aim to establish a deep learning-assisted system for breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and NAC response prediction, so as to reduce the burdens of doctors and improve the survival rate as well as the life quality of patients.
