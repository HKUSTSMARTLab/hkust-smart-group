date: 2022-07-01
summary: COVID-19 has been a threat to everyone's health in the past few years, and the automatic segmentation of 3D CT plays a vital role in the COVID-19 diagnosis. The annotations for 3D CT are limited and expensive to obtain. We aim to use self-supervised learning to utilize the unlabeled 3D CT best to improve the segmentation performance for COVID-19 diagnoisis.
